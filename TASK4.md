Implementation of linear regression model on a particular dataset involves various functions. The key concepts involved in deriving the linear regression model are as follows
Given our simple linear equation y=mx+b, we can calculate MSE as:

We can calculate the gradient of this cost function as:
 
The steps involving in implementation of the linear regression model are as follows:
1.	Firstly we create a class LinearRegression. In the init function we set the learning the rate value to 0.001 and number of iterations to default value 1000

2.	Now we define a fit method which takes the training samples and labels associated with them and the gradient descent function is implemented in this step as per the formula specified

3.	Then the predict method is defined which gets the new test samples

5.	The data splitted as training data and testing data The size value 0.2 indicates that 80% of the samples are used to train the model and the remaining 20% to evaluate or test the model. For this purpose, we use we utilize the scikit learn library's train_test_split() function as shown

4.Then the predict method is defined which gets the new test samples and approximate the values as per a linear model and uses sigmoid function. It predicts 1 if the value is greater than 0.5 and 0 if the value is less than 0.5


5.The necessary libraries are imported and the iris dataset is loaded

6.The data splitted as training data and testing data
The size value 0.2 indicates that 80% of the samples are used to train the model and the remaining 20% to evaluate or test the model. For this purpose, we use we utilize the scikit learn library's train_test_split() function as shown
